## üß± Class Diagram

The **Class Diagram** is a fundamental component of object-oriented design. It provides a blueprint of the system‚Äôs structure by illustrating the system's classes, attributes, methods, and the relationships between them.

### üìå Importance of the Class Diagram

- **Visualizes System Structure:** It offers a clear visual representation of how the system is organized into objects and how these objects interact with each other.
- **Supports Object-Oriented Development:** Helps developers understand the classes they need to create, how they relate, and how they interact.
- **Improves Code Maintainability:** By seeing dependencies and associations clearly, developers can update and refactor code more efficiently.
- **Assists in Planning and Communication:** Great tool for technical communication among team members, especially in larger development teams.

### üîç What It Represents

The Class Diagram in the PlantyCare project describes the core entities involved in the mobile application and their relationships, including:

- **Classes and Their Responsibilities:** Such as `User`, `PredictionResult`, `CropData`, `FertilizerRecommendation`, and `FirebaseManager`.
- **Attributes:** For example, a `User` class might include `name`, `email`, `profileImage`, and `joinDate`.
- **Methods (Functions):** Like `uploadImage()`, `getPrediction()`, or `saveHistory()`.
- **Relationships:**
  - **Association** (e.g., A `User` has many `PredictionResult`s)
  - **Inheritance** (if any shared base classes exist)
  - **Dependency** (e.g., `PredictionResult` depends on data from the AI model)

### üß† How It Helps in the PlantyCare Project

- Organizes features like AgriCure, PlantPick, and FertiGuide into manageable components.
- Clarifies which classes are responsible for managing Firebase interactions.
- Ensures the system follows a modular, scalable design.
- Reduces development complexity by laying out responsibilities clearly.

### üõ†Ô∏è Use in Development

Throughout the development of the PlantyCare mobile application, the Class Diagram acts as a guide during:

- Code structure design
- Object creation and data handling
- Maintenance, updates, and debugging
- Team collaboration and understanding feature responsibilities
